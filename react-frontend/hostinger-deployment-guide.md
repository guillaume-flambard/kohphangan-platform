# Hostinger Deployment Guide for Waterfall Party App

## Quick Deployment to phangan.ai

Since you have the domain `phangan.ai` on Hostinger, here's the simplest way to get your waterfall party ticket system live immediately:

### Option 1: Direct Upload (Fastest - 5 minutes)

1. **Download the pre-built app**:
   - File: `phangan-ai-waterfall-party.zip` (already created)
   - Contains: All built React files ready for hosting

2. **Upload to Hostinger**:
   - Log into your Hostinger control panel
   - Go to File Manager for phangan.ai
   - Upload and extract the zip file to your domain's root directory
   - The app will be live at: `https://phangan.ai/events/waterfall/echo`

### Option 2: Subdomain Setup (Recommended)

1. **Create subdomain in Hostinger**:
   - Create subdomain: `tickets.phangan.ai`
   - Upload the zip contents to this subdomain
   - Access at: `https://tickets.phangan.ai`

### File Structure After Upload
```
public_html/ (or subdomain folder)
├── index.html              # Main app file
├── assets/
│   ├── index-BpERBH4U.css # Styles
│   └── index-yqtVV15l.js  # React app bundle
```

### Required .htaccess File (for React Router)
Create this file in your upload directory:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Handle Angular and React Routes
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]

# Security headers
Header always set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"

# Cache static assets
<FilesMatch "\.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$">
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
</FilesMatch>

# Gzip compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css

    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
